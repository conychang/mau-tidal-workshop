# DAY1｜Introduction

My name is Chiho Oka, and I am in charge of the TidalCycles (or SuperCollider) workshop in the Media Technology Workshop.<br>I am usually familiar with computer music involving improvisational operations or experimental music with pre-written scores.

- [Instruction](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xPiOaN7etlZH8bn6S1LUISLm4vTGM8DE/view?usp=sharing) *It is restricted so only I (Chiho) can see it.

Sometimes I show things or ideas that occur to me in practice or performance in a way that is hard to describe as a musical performance. For example, an event that uses cursors and automated programs, Jenga, bicycles and sine waves.

- [Park Concert by Nothto, knd](https://togetter.com/li/184897) <br>[I was at the May 2022 Park Concert (in collaboration with K/A/T/O MASSACRE (Regular party in Forestlimit, Hatagaya, Tokyo).](https://twitter.com/chihooka/status/1521855623008202753?s=20&t=KgyMGKaN5K4oewKIIR6mRQ) I played a sine wave while riding my bike. At one end of the park, the frequency starts at 20 Hz and gradually increases. At the other end of the park, it is at 20000 Hz. 20-20000 Hz is the human audible range.<br>

BUoY in Kitasenju, which I help occasionally, is battling noise complaints, and in response to this, I and one another staff are doing [a very quiet sound project](https://buoy.or.jp/program/silent-music-party-1/).
- https://note.com/buoy_tokyo/n/nc663f8c506dd
> Originally, we asked visitors to BUoY in advance to follow our volume control rules and refrain from hanging out or smoking in front of the building, but recently we have been paying more attention to volume, especially because of the problems that have occurred regarding sound. However, due to recent problems with sound, we have been paying more attention to the volume of sound.
>
> So this time, we decided to regard volume restrictions as a kind of aesthetic rule, which led us to hold this project.
> Simply put, this means "to do a project that makes use of small or weak sounds," but in reality it may be more complicated than this.
> How are we supposed to produce or hear sounds when we are placed in an "inappropriately loud" listening environment that is too small for our normal listening environment?
> We should be able to spontaneously explore a wide variety of musical styles, even within a narrow volume range... that's the "Dynamics Range Segmatic" group!

The above works and activities are carried out while dealing with the knowledge and techniques acquired mainly in the field of sound.

As an undergraduate student in university, [I traveled and other activities while learning so much about sound and computers through live coding, and watching a party called Algorave](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NHtM2UoC4gtNNszc5TizxmPcT3mXieXSpMOp_l0oECo/edit?usp=sharing), which led me not only to learn technology related to sound and sound synthesis software, or to compose and perform music, but also to I believe that this was the first step in thinking deeply about the cultural sphere surrounding music, including the medium of sound that makes up music, the systems that generate it, and how the audience receives such systems. <br>
I would like to organize this class by recalling the workshops in Sheffield and other events I attended around this time.

## What's Algorave?
- https://algorave.com/about/
- https://github.com/Algorave/guidelines

> Algorave is made from “sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive conditionals“. These days just about all electronic music is made using software, but with artificial barriers between the people creating the software algorithms and the people making the music. Using systems built for creating algorithmic music and visuals, such as IXI Lang, puredata, Max/MSP, SuperCollider, Extempore, Fluxus, TidalCycles, Gibber, Sonic Pi, FoxDot and Cyril these barriers are broken down, and musicians are able to compose and work live with their music as algorithms. This has good and bad sides, but a different approach leads to interesting places.
>
> This is no new idea, but Algoraves focus on humans making and dancing to music. Algorave musicians don’t pretend their software is being creative, they take responsibility for the music they make, shaping it using whatever means they have. More importantly the focus is not on what the musician is doing, but on the music, and people dancing to it. Algoraves embrace the alien sounds of raves from the past, and introduce alien, futuristic rhythms and beats made through strange, algorithm-aided processes. It’s up to the good people on the dancefloor to help the musicians make sense of this and do the real creative work in making a great party.

## Let's try it out and touch it.
### Estuary: https://estuary.mcmaster.ca/<br>
A web-based platform for collaboration, but a subset (easy version) of TidalCycles, MiniTidal, can be used without installation, useful for simple tutorials.

1. Choose "SOLO MODE"
2. Choose any box and select "MiniTidal" from the pull-down menu for that box.
3. Just write down `sound "bd"` in the box。
4. Press "▶" button. Then the sound should come out.
5. To stop the sound, either delete everything in the box and press "▶" or write `-- ` in front of the code, for example `-- sound "bd"`. Lines prefixed with `-- ` will be recognized by Tidal as comments, not code.
***

### The Basics
    sound "bd"
In Tidal, time is expressed in cps (cycles per second). The basic idea is that the cycle is repeated over and over again.... The `sound "bd"` that I wrote for testing means that the sample "bd" is repeated once per cycle per n second.

and can also be shorted as:

    s "bd"

So, what conditions do you think the following will show? If you can guess, rewrite the code and run it to find out.

    s "bd bd"

    s "bd*2"

What do we have other than the "bd" sample? You can refer to it here: https://github.com/tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples<br>
There are several samples in each folder and you can play them; Tidal will reference the name of the folder containing the samples. If you find a folder name that interests you, rewrite the code and run it. Also, here is what it sounds like, just to see what it sounds like.

    s "808"

    s "808:0"
    -- 0 is the index number of file.

    s "808" #n 0

    s "808:1"


  Of course, different samples can be mixed.

    s "808 bd cp"

    s "808*2 bd*3 cp*4"

    s "808:1*2 bd*3 cp:1*4"

Note that the more steps in a pattern, the faster it plays so that everything can be squeezed in. No matter how many patterns you cram in, they will regenerate to fit within a single cycle.

As described above, `sound` is a function that sounds samples in various patterns. We will combine this with another function using the `$` symbol.

    s "bd*6"

    fast 6 $ s "bd*6"

    slow 6 $ s "bd*6"

    jux (fast 6) $ s "bd*6"

    every 4 (fast 6) $ s "bd*6"

    palindrome $ s "arpy:0 arpy:1 arpy:2 arpy:3"

    stack [s "bd*4", s "arpy*3", s "hh*5"]

The `#` allows you to connect audio effects.

    stack [s "bd*4", s "arpy*3", s "hh*5"] #note "1 3 5"

    stack [s "bd*4", s "arpy*3", s "hh*5"] #n (irand 8)

    stack [s "bd*4", s "arpy*3", s "hh*5"] #speed "1 3 5"

    s "cp*2" #end 0.2

Various other notations are also available.

    stack [s "bd*4", s "arpy*3", s "hh*5"] #note "[0, 4, 7]"

    s "arpy*3?"

    s "~ cp"

    s "~ [~ cp]"

Click on the "?" button in the upper right corner of the page, you will see many more samples. Try to learn various functions and effectors. Also, check out the TidalCycles reference page for a detailed introduction!。http://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/cycles *A little note that some of these are not on MiniTidal.

## Mexicode
A style of performance in which several people take turns coding on a single computer with TidalCycles installed. I saw it done often at workshops. I heard it is called "Mexicode" because it is the Mexican style.

### Note: The difference between Tidalcycles and MiniTidal
Before describing the pattern, indicate at the beginning of the sentence which "connection" from d1 to d16 is to be used. It may be easier to understand if you think of it as basically being prepared from Layer 1 to Layer 9, or something like that.

    d1 $ s "bd"

You can also imagine that you can create many patterns with names such as

    p "myptn" $ s "bd"

The code in the editor for Tidal used for this Mexicode can be executed with `command + enter`.<br>

Also, if you want to turn off the sound that is sounding on `d1`, for example

    d1 silence

If you want to sound only `d1`, use `solo`

    solo d1

Removing the solo status is done by `unsolo`

    unsolo d1

If you want to mute all sound, use `hush`.

    hush
